## General info

This project will get us a deeper understanding of:

* Distribution channel of the products
* Regions and which channel dominates in which region
* Annual spendings on freesh products in a given channel
* Which product are dominating each distribution channel

Now more about the dataset, the datasets is gethered from
kaggle.com, and contains about 450 enterys.

The goal is to create multiple visualizations explaining us how the whole system
is organised and how much revenu it generates.

In the follwing time I will continuously update the README.md file and give a deep
explanation of each step done while working on this project.

## Technologies

The technologies I will use here are:
* Python 3.7,
* Jupyter Notebook,
* Visual Studio Code,
* Git

## Analysis

### Channel domination
In the first visualization we created the first pie chart which holds info about the dominant distribution channel.

We can clearly see that the first distribution channel is the dominant channel, in the visualization of the Channels devided per regions.

### Region domination

In the following chart we will see the domination of the Region per distribution channels.

### Product Segment Revenu 

In the Products segments we can see the revenu that the products generate for each Distribution Channel.
